## My process

This challenge was so fun to do! The use of flexbox helped me to create the layout, and a little bit of semantic HTML to create the structure. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned about how to change the type of cursor with css, practice a little bit to add icons, and i learn how to add animations to the fontawesome icons! Also i tried to use a color palette that has a good contrast for accesibility!

### Continued development

I'd like to add more socials in the future, and also add even interactive elements and animations :)


### Useful resources

- [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - This helped me with the map icon.
- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_class_cursor.php) - This is an amazing article which helped me to understand the types of cursors and how to change it with css.
- [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) - I used it to find a good color palette.
- [Coolors Contrast Checker](https://coolors.co/contrast-checker/000000-a3b18a) - I used it to check the contrast between colors for accesibility.

Big thanks to @perterHUAN who gave me a lot of tips and feedback with the Blog Card Preview Challenge. It helped me a lot! Specially the padding tip to avoid using innecesary margins in every container like the previous challenge. Thanks! ;)
